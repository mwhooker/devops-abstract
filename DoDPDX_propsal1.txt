Abstract

    The role of IT administrators is constantly evolving. We've been burdened
(bestowed?) with the task of automating as much as possible as our
infrastructure changes faster than we can keep up.

    Until 2005, you were probably using CFEngine or shell scripts and whatever
package manager your OS supported. Around that time Puppet and Chef dropped, and
it was enlightening. Then, in 2008, EC2 went stable, and the term DevOps started
gaining popularity the next year.

    With modern configuration management tools and an elastic supply of
machines to run them on, we were able to start creating software-defined
infrastructure.

    Unfortunately, both Puppet and Chef arrived just on the cusp of the
transition to IaaS, before we understood best practices for operating in this
new environment. These tools were the product of years of experience operating
raw hardware. There is something lost in translation when we apply these tools
to the cloud.

    This talk is about how we've worked to bridge the gap, to go
Cloud-Native. I'll demonstrate the impedance mismatch that occurs when you run
chef in the cloud, and one weird trick we use to exploit the capabilities of
IaaS. We start by eliminating chef-server, and end with spinning up new instances
in 20 seconds.

    By the end I hope I can convince you that there are ways to operate with
more agility, to insulate yourselves from failure, and let every engineer sleep
better at night.

    I also hope to inspire you to look for the gaps, and to come up with better
ways to close them. This is only the beginning. We need fresh eyes and ideas.
