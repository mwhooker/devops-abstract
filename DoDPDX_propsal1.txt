Abstract

    As the role of IT administration has evolved, so have the tools. 


With each iteration automation has been the
common thread that drives progress to the next plateau.

    Tools like Chef and Puppet helped to end the nightmare of shell scripts and
distro-specific packaging, and gave us the idea of "DevOps", which is the
reification of infrastructure. However, these tools arrived on the cusp of the
transition in to the cloud, and so they were built for the realities of data
centers and raw hardware.

    This talk is about how we've attempted to bridge the gap to "Cloud-Native"
DevOps. I'll try to demonstrate how some perceived drawbacks of the cloud
can actually be huge advantages if used correctly.

    I'll show that Chef has fundamental flawed and that operating in the
cloud actually provides a way forward.
